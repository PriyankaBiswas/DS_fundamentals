    "My background is in experimental linguistics, I study user's mental models through quantitative methods. By mental models I mean what they think, what they do and why they do that, what influencing factors are behind their decision. Traditional qualitative methods in user research understands users' action and gather insights to understand the user. Quantitative methods, on the other hand, could be useful in predicting users' behavior and hence would help decision making for products and user experience. I'd like to leverage my background and skill sets to build predictive models around user engagement and product usage so that product developers ability to incorporate anticipatory designs into their products to keep users engaged.\n",

    "I am passionate about  applying natural language processing techniques and Machine Learning for addressing business questions surrounding user experience. For example, a company may have textual responses from qualitative research projects (e.g., intercept, NPS or customer feedback surveys), and yet they do not know how to build predictive models to forecast product success, or product lifetime. Using NLP and machine learning I can combine text mining with predictive modeling to learn from historical data, to help businesses make more informed decisions.\n",

    "My background is in experimental linguistics, I help businesses understand what people think, what they do and why they do what they do. The answers to these questions are very valuable as businesses like to understand who their users are, what they think about their product, and why they choose/reject their products. I leverage my background and skill sets to answer these questions, and recommend approaches for the business to reach out to their users. \n",

    "Lots of businesses these days have massive amounts of data on their users but they do not know how to extract value from it. They often donâ€™t even know what questions to ask, much less how to utilize it to improve business opportunities. A business may have textual responses from surveys, and yet they do not know how to build predictive models to forecast product success, or product lifetime. A Data Scientist with a NLP background will be able to combine text mining with predictive modeling to learn from historical data, to help businesses better understand its customers and make more informed decisions.\n",
