    "(1) Data Source: Amsterdam availability data scraped from AirBnB on December 24th. Question: What are the popular neighborhoods in Amsterdam?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: First of all, the availability data could look very different depending on the continent. In USA, Americans spend their time at home with families, whereas, non-Americans (dare I say, immigrants) take the oppotunity to explore popular landmarks during this time. \n",
    "\n",
    "For Europe, 24th December could see similar trends. However, considering the fact that Amsterdam is a popular tourist destination, it is likely that the data for that day could give the impression that all neighborhoods in Amsterdam is popular. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: There will be a huge upsurge in mental health services following 9/11 in New York city. Therefore, the posed question will definitely give a wrong estimation. \n",

    "(3) Data Source: Armenian Pub Survey. Question: What are the most common reasons Armenians visit local pubs?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Is this a question hovering on how the survey has been phrased? Looking at the column metrics for the data, I see the two most relevant column names (Prim_Imp) and (Sec_Imp) ask the questions: \"Which feature is of primary/secondary importance for you?\" This refers to the feature of the pub, and does not reflect the pub-goer's reasons. So, I guess we can not answer the question. \n",
